  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In this repository, you will find a well-organized collection of projects, with detailed information about each one. Each project includes a description, details about the dataset used, techniques and tools employed, as well as key findings and learnings.</p>
  
  <h2>(Non Guided) Projects</h2>
  <h3>(SARIMA/RNN/LSTM) Financial Time Series Analisys for Raizen Stock Prices Raizen</h3>
  <p>In this project, I explored a dataset of financial time series from Raizen Company and other correlated. I performed exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, trends, and relevant insights. I utilized popular visualization libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn to create graphs and visualizations that aided in understanding the data.</p>

  <h3>(NLP/NetworkX/Pyvis) Graph analysis and visualization of the GOT Books using NetworkX and Pivys</h3>
  <p>In this project, I worked with the Game of Thrones (GOT) books dataset to perform graph analysis and visualization. I used libraries such as NetworkX and Pivys to analyze the relationships between characters and visualize the network of interactions. This provided insights into the social structure and dynamics within the books.</p>

  <h3>(EDA and APIs) Exploratory Data Analysis Using Youtube Video Data from Valorant Channels</h3>
   <p>In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using YouTube video data from Valorant channels. I collected data through APIs and performed EDA to gain insights into video metrics, engagement, and trends. I used visualizations to present the findings and uncover patterns related to Valorant content on YouTube.</p>
  
  <h2>(Guided) Projects</h2>
  <h3>(Classification) IBM Rain Prediction in Australia</h3>
  <p>In this project, I worked on rain prediction in Australia using machine learning classification techniques. I explored the dataset, performed data preprocessing, and built a classification model to predict whether it would rain on a given day. I evaluated the model's performance and analyzed the important features affecting rain prediction.</p>

  
  <h3>(Regression) IBM House Sales in King Count USA</h3>
  <p>In this project, I worked on predicting house prices in King County, USA, using regression techniques. I analyzed the dataset, performed data preprocessing, and built a regression model to predict house prices based on various features. I evaluated the model's performance and provided insights into the factors influencing house prices.</p>
